# What is Ruby?

^ Ruby is a programming language

---

## “Programming Language”

^ A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.

^ Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

---

![fit](media/compiler-virtual-machine.png)

^ Modern "programming language" generally refers to higher-level human readable code as opposed to lower level "machine language" instructions your computer hardware understands.

---

![fit](media/i-heard-you-like-programming-languages.png)

^ Programming languages are basically written in other programming languages.

^ Which might beg the question, “which came first, the chicken or the egg?”

---

![fit](media/first-program.png)

^ This is generally considered to be the first computer program ever written.

^ Anyone guess when this was written?
^ Around 1840 (that’s about 175 years ago).

^ Charles Babbage gives a lecture in Italy, 1840 about his theoretical computation machine, the Analytical Engine, written up in French by an Italian engineer.

^ Eventually Ada Lovelace is commissioned to translate it to English. She augments it with her own notes, the last of which, Note G includes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers.

---

![fit](media/analytic-engine.jpg)

^ It is considered the first algorithm ever written for implementation on a computer.

^ Ada made the conceptual leap that the Analytical Engine could be used to solve problems of any complexity.* This photo is of a recreation, at the time the machine what hypothetical, and had yet to be constructed.

^ * She was only 27.

![fit](media/punch-card.jpg)

^ The first "modern" programming languages, like Fortran were punched into cards.

^ Nowadays we use text editors and IDEs to edit code.

^ Not boxes full of punched cards.

![fit](media/matz.jpg)

^ Yukihiro Matsumoto
^ first released Ruby in December of 1995.

^ "Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming. So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."

# MINISWAN

# [fit] Syntax

---

# Math

```ruby

2 + 2

```

---

# Math

```ruby

2 + 2 # => 4

```

---

# Comments

```ruby

# This is a comment

```

^ not a hashtag

^ Ruby ignores anything on a line after the #

---

# Variables

```ruby
x = 5
```

^ assignment to a variable

---

# Math + Variables

```ruby
x * 2 # => 10
```

^ variables can be used in statements

---

# Strings

```ruby
s = "This is a string of characters."
```

^ between the quotes is a “string of characters”

---

# Methods

```ruby
s.upcase # => "THIS IS A STRING OF CHARACTERS."
```

---

# Conditionals

```ruby
name = "Jason"
if name === "Jason"
  puts "Hello there #{name}"
end
```

^ conditionals

---

# User Input

```ruby
name = gets.chomp
if name === "Jason"
  puts "Hello there #{name}"
end
```

^ conditionals

---

# Loops

```ruby

count = 1
loop do
  puts "The count is #{count}"
  count += 1
  if count > 10
    break
  end
end

# The count is 1
# The count is 2
# The count is 3
# The count is 4
# The count is 5
# The count is 6
# The count is 7
# The count is 8
# The count is 9
# The count is 10
